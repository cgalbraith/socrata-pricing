## Hawaii
Hawaii said that it made sense to skip the competitive procurement
process because it would be expensive to switch from Socrata to other
means. This is funny. If Socrata export were easier, Hawaii could
have a competitive procurement. Because of this mild form of 
anti-competitive vendor lock-in, Hawaii, decides that it is not
reasonable to have a competitive procurement.
